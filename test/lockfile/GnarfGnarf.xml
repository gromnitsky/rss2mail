<p>Let's put things in perspective. In Calgary, and many other cold cities, every apartment's outdoor parking lot has outlets where you plug in your ICE's block heater and battery blanket. Without them, you probably won't start your car this morning.<p>When I lived in Calgary, I sometimes had to spray a can of ether into the carburetor to get my car started.</p>

<p>In order to use DNA tests in genealogy, you need to know every segment on every chromosome that matches. Matching is not a go/nogo proposition. There are degrees of matching that depend on the biological relationship. Ex: Parent/children average 3,700 cM (centiMorgans), siblings are 2,600 cM, first cousins 900 cM etc.<p>See: <a href="https://whoareyoumadeof.com/blog/need-a-dna-centimorgan-chart/" rel="nofollow">https://whoareyoumadeof.com/blog/need-a-dna-centimorgan-char...</a></p>

<p>The whole point of DNA testing in genealogy is to quantify your connections with other people. So an isolated home test would be of no benefit.</p>

<p>We ran out of columns in our 80-column Hollerith card master file. So we divided the 12-row columns into three groups of four bits, giving us the “240-column” card, with triple storage.<p>This was the 70’s, so our cards looked like lace doilies (0111).</p>

<p>Not only did I program with cards (Assembler) in 1970, but my employer managed a master file of 40,000 cards, sorted by account number. Every day we posted updates by matching transaction files to the master, and selecting out cards that corresponded to updates. In the second pass of the day, we merged new and updated cards into the master file. Two hours per run.<p>1,000 cards/minute is an infernal racket. Imagine a picker knife slamming 17 cards/second by the edges. It would jam occasionally, and we had to meticulously reconstitute the torn card on the keypunch.</p>

<p>There is a strange paradox where sometimes you see a bit coming and it's hysterical, other times it's predictable and falls flat.<p>Ex (first case): In <i>Ruthless People</i>, they walk into a store to play a VHS tape on a VCR. They don't know (but we do) that the tape contains embarrassing scenes, which are about to be displayed to the whole store.<p>Another example of first case: In <i>Asterix</i>, whenever the Pirate Ship appears. We know (and they know) they're about to get trounced.<p>With the Three Stooges, we know he's going to smack him upside the head, the question is just how's he going to do it this time?</p>

<p>I think comedians and humourists are teachers. They examine things in new ways and show us how to look at our condition. Laughter comes from the joy of learning.<p>Comedians from earlier generations are less funny because their message has been absorbed into our culture, and what they discovered then, has become understood, accepted, and is no longer new or surprising.</p>
