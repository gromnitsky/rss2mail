<p>If your toolbox (dictated by your profession) is slightly richer than console applications, you automatically dealing with the applications which are natively "tiled" inside the application windows. And you work with maximized windows of your main applications (natively "tiled" inside) and with a set of small applications that you need to access periodically and these apps do not require full screen mode.<p>You can alt-tab between them on a single screen, you can switch or swipe virtual desktops with them, you can do anything, a result will be the same.<p>There are no advantages because of this sameness.</p>

<p>First you need to infantilize them to the level of “I’m ready to do anything to be in their gang.”<p>But at the same time, you need to feed snobbery so that you get a safe mixture of 80% immaturity and 20% snobbery.<p>Let’s add two drops of self-deprecation, that boring feeling of “I don’t have blue bubbles, I’m worthless and a loser.”<p>And now you can take a large bag for money and leave it open - they will fill it themselves, tie it and send it to the address :)</p>

<p>Let's be precise in definitions and start with the obvious "it's not an engineering at all".<p>Moreover, according to the ECPD's engineering definition (or to an any other commonly accepted and accepted by the engineering community definition) those fancy "prompt engineering" is pure anti-engineering at all.<p>This disdain for engineering is something of a tragedy. And it is also the result of the "washout" of engineering from post-industrial societies.</p>

<p>Yes, your blog is not interesting to anyone. Even the search engines are not interested in it, because they are not looking for something interesting. And HRs are not interested in it, because HRs generally do formal work and they are not interested in details. And the worst person in any crowd is the one who sticks to everyone "did you read my blog?".<p>It's true.<p>But people blog and will do it because...</p>

<p>Maybe yes, maybe no, it doesn't matter.<p>The business model matters. The answer to the question: how does the platform earn to maintain its work?<p>If there is an answer and it is explicit (no matter what it is and how much someone likes or dislikes the business model), it is much better than if there is no answer or it is implicit.<p>Because everything implicit and muddy can be the basis of anything, for example, of hidden but paid propaganda. The injection of ideas is not so annoying at the initial stage, a good nurse gives painless injections. But then the substance will certainly begin to act. A harmless substance may cause a desire for spontaneous purchase and is therefore generally safe. But harmful substances are different ...<p>Intrusive ads are the lesser of evils. If we think about it well, of course.</p>
