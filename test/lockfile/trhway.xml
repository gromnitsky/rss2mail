<p>Russia runs German law system, it is just the results are so different that one has hard time to believe that it is the same system. The same with governance - German modeled, just again with very different results.<p>The Spanish is good contender, agree, though, German I think closer and historically provided more influence - there were no noticeable Spanish speaking, Spanish literature nor philosophy in Russia, while German speakers, German literature and philosophy were massively present.</p>

<p>>There's an urban legend about AI and tanks whose punchline was that: on the battlefield all tanks looked Soviet, because the images of Soviet tanks in the training set were the blurry ones taken from the air.<p>to that I raise you the story of the Soviet mine carrying dogs who were trained to destroy tanks. As it happened they were trained using Soviet tanks. And Soviet tanks used diesel. German tanks were gasoline-powered...<p>>I don't know if anyone outside the actual developers (and given jamming perhaps not even them) really knows how accurate such onboard AI is right now.<p>The battlefield is constantly watched by a multitude of drones, including ones far and high, outside of jamming range, and with good optics. So, all the info is there, though not in the open naturally. It is reported by various sources that despite the jamming (Russia even installs the jamming right onto the tanks) and everything, 70% of armor is killed with drones currently. Though Eric Schmidt making such drones for Ukraine would know better :)</p>

<p>a tank - 1000kw of heat - on a thermal camera is very hard to hide. And drones are frequently carry thermal in addition to standard camera.<p>For smaller targets, like humans, thermal-stealth clothing plus standard background patterning would probably work to some degree, though I think that soon those autonomous
 drones will in huge numbers be spread on the battlefield and sit quietly waiting like landmines and would be able to identify by movements/etc their targets even when the targets are well-blended into the background.</p>

<p>I'd venture a guess at least partially explaining it - Russia has been importing/cargo-culting German style of education, science, government, law, military, etc. for several centuries. Before 1917 like a half of the top of the Russian government and society was German. Lenin for example was half-German. The modern Russian language has developed during the last about 300 years, and the most closest/easiest non-Slavic European language for Russians is German. That all didn't make Russians into Germans, far for it, yet it lets Russians understand and mimicry the German style when needed (at least much easily than say French, English or Italian. Also kind of not surprising that the USSR was helping the revolution in Germany, and later the first 2 mega-totalitarian regimes happened to be Germany and USSR, and they were allies the first 2 years of WWII fighting together against democratic countries of Europe).<p>And of course USSR had Eastern Germany for 40+ years - enough to develop deep networks and poison the minds.</p>

<p>My understanding that even with crossbow the hunter is in no danger. Going with a knife against a large deer would probably be something that may start to feel like a small achievement.</p>

<p>>it's too easy or "unsporting" to hunt deer in this way<p>To hunt a defenseless deer with a firearm is unsporting in any way. Anyone wanting real, not pretend, sport of hunting can go to Ukraine. One can use any weapons, cameras, lights  and drones there, and it still will be noble and "sporting".</p>

<p>On the other side this unwillingness and mental non-acceptance of those reports/manuals/etc. as a wasteful activity frequently comes from the understanding that there are more efficient ways of doing things, and that drives the "software eating the world" effect. While I naturally don't know the details of the case you mention and pharma is far from the domains I've been in, yet in many business/enterprise situations the software approach is to code the many-page guide into business logic, including ETL-ing the data instead of manual import, etc.<p>Move fast and break things brings you to the Moon in a decade using primitive tech, where is total process compliance can't do that even in 50 years using much more advanced tech.</p>

<p>>"Generate a scene of 17th century kings of Scotland playing golf." -> The result should not be a bunch of black men and Asian women dressed up as Scottish kings, it should be a bunch of white guys.<p>is black man in the role of the Scottish king represents a bigger error than some other errors in such an image, like say incorrect dress details or the landscape having say a wrong hill? I'd venture a guess that only our racially charged mentality of today considers that a big error, and may be in a generation or 2 an incorrect landscape or dress detail would be considered much larger error than a mismatched race.</p>

<p>as drones are illegal in many places and are just targetted on the battlefield like in Ukraine, I wonder when we are going to get drones looking (and with time more and more behaving) like a bird.</p>

<p>For bio-terrorism you can just use dirty homemade version. For injection (for cosmetics and valid medical reasons like spasms) you'd want to use clean lab-produced. So I think that is the reason justifying its production. The security theater around, beyond the basic security, is I think mainly just a part of the moat and the politicians having to look tough on anything resembling a possibility for terrorism. I think it is similar to say marijuana research - in half the states one can do at home all the research one likes, yet the the official academia would have to jump through impossible hoops to do any marijuana research.</p>
