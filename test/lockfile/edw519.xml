<p>This is fantastic! I especially like the examples with curves, which I continue to struggle with, along with clipping.<p>Personally, I'm partial to path which can do almost anything and tends to be less verbose than other methods.<p>Long time student, but I see that I still have lots to learn.<p>I suck so much at drawing and dislike images so much that for ease and performance, I built my entire side project with svg.<p>After today, it looks like I have quite a bit of refactoring to do. Thank you, OP!<p><a href="https://eddiots.com/1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://eddiots.com/1</a></p>

<p>I have been a professional programmer for 44 years and have NEVER had "job market anxiety". Why? Because I sincerely believe that there is zero correlation between the job market and my ability to find work.<p>I don't pay attention to what anyone says about the economy, the market, or anything else macro, especially on the internet. And I have gone through times that were much much worse than now.<p>I never worried about losing any job because I was certain I could find another. The longest I've ever been out of work was for a few weeks.<p>A few tips:<p><pre><code>  - Have x months expenses in the bank. Take the pressure off.
  - Have multiple resumes ready to go, programmer, analyst, sys admin, manager, even data entry.
  - Stay in touch with your network. Not to get a job. Just to stay in touch.
  - Keep your skills fresh. Always have a side project.
  - Remember we're not in energy, education, or manufacturing. Their cycles are killers. Our in tech are not. Everyone else depends on us.
  - Fuck anxiety. We build stuff out of nothing. We're stronger than bad news.</code></pre></p>

<p>LIFE LESSONS FROM A 68 YEAR OLD.<p>November 30, 2023<p>1. Don’t exercise to be strong. Exercise to be healthy.<p>2. The best place for ideas is where ever works best for you.<p>3. What she said. And carry and pencil and pocket-sized notebook everywhere. People say I have a great memory. It's a hack, not a gift.<p>4. In relationships, the most important thing is love. If you have it, no problem is too big. Without it, who cares?<p>5. If sex ever becomes hard work, become a hooker. You might as well get paid.<p>6. Consider a pet before having anything else.<p>7. At any age, if you take care of yourself, you will not experience irrational weight gain. Nothing happens out of nowhere for no reason at all. There are no rewards or punishments, only consequences.<p>8. Sometimes in life, the best thing to do, is to <insert whatever works for you>.<p>9. In a long term relationship, be either "all in" or not. If you're "all in", be "all in".<p>10. Learn the difference between issues and details. Issues matter. Details don't.<p>11. Allow aquaintances to come and go. True friendships are so rare and precious, never lose them. (I learned that the hard way too many times.)<p>12. Give every "no show" one opportunity to apologize. After that, ghost them. No matter what happens, it will be for the best.<p>13. Never allow anyone to "make you feel" anything. You must always decide how to feel yourself.<p>14. If you're too stupid to use a condom, you get what you deserve. Unfortunately sometimes your child gets what you deserve too.<p>15. The more you know, the lower the percentage of everything there is to know will be known by you.<p>16. Don't pick the phone up in the first place. (There, you just eliminated the need for 4,528 "put your phone down" rules.<p>17. See #14, #15, and #16.<p>18. See #16. See how easy.<p>19. Apply #16 to social media. Except Hacker News.<p>20. If you're older than the author of a listicle, you have automatic permission to build upon it with your own listicle.<p>OP, thanks for the nice list, and the opportunity to play along with good clean fun. :-)</p>

<p>Nice catch, ExtraRoulette! You're the first to notice.<p>This project is new. My plan was to write a "comic generator", where I would just input parameters and it would generate the comics.<p>It worked even better than I expected. In the last 6 months, it has generated 2700 comics from my inputs.<p>Then I realized that if I launched 7/1/23, it would take 10 years just to post what I already had, even at one per day.<p>So I just reset my start date from 1/1/23 to 1/1/14. I wanted to launch with a lot of content so people could explore.<p>I also wanted the site to be evergreen which is why I try not to dig too deep into specific technologies. But COVID was obviously too big to ignore.<p>I sorted my backlog a few weeks ago based on many factors, but I guess 344 slipped through the cracks. I think I'll leave it there to see if anyone else notices.</p>
