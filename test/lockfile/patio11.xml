<p>Good news on this specific issue: the current year will be both the final year of the old era and the 元年 (first year) of the new one. The following calendar year is the  2nd of the new era. So in most cases you have a window of time to get ready to update systems to accommodate e.g. Japanese counterparties whose systems want you to specify dates of birth using eras in preference to the Western calendar.<p>One of the relatively few bits of ultimately consequential engineering I did in the last few years was assisting a colleague in grepping for comments we had both left identifying code to update in the event of a new era. (We are currently, of course, in Reiwa 6, and Heisei ended in what most HNers consider 2019.)</p>

<p>They’re certainly not instantly cleared in the standard banking use of the term?<p>I don’t doubt that you can reduce risk by e.g. using novel infrastructure which looks up the account number on the check then uses (for example) a debit card network to check the account’s currently available balance. However, even if you were looking at someone’s balance on their mobile app while they were writing the check to you, that would not suffice to guarantee that the check would not be returned as NSF. The bank can choose to NSF it for a variety of reasons, for example if they prioritize “today’s” debit card transactions over “today’s” checks in the posting order, or a check previously deposited (and included in that available balance) gets NSFed and yanked back by another bank.</p>

<p>“Gremlins.”<p>All financial infrastructure is a patched-together collection of systems spread across multiple different firms made of multiple suborgs with vastly different levels of observability into and understanding of their local part of the total system. For many routine problems, the cost of having a rigorous answer to “What just happened?” is far, far greater than the dollar amount at stake in the transaction. You’d need the equivalent of a federal agency doing an after-accident investigation to make headway, at the cost of millions.<p>So we chalk it up to gremlins and move on, for better or worse. (This is one reason why financial institutions have an operational losses budget. Sometimes the gremlins eat someone’s money. So you just charge it to Ops Losses and move on.)</p>

<p>Checks also let you do fairly complex multiparty commerce without needing to spend millions of dollars engineering it, like an apartment broker requiring you to give them a check for deposit/first month’s rent and signed lease prior to releasing the keys to you. Note that the check is to <i>the landlord</i> and the broker cannot access her accounts, but visual inspection of a check plus the previous underwriting lets this work without needing to loop landlord in again (in real time) to release keys.</p>

<p>A thing I try to keep as a through line in discussing legacy infrastructure, and checks in the U.S. are definitely legacy infrastructure, is both a) how we ended up here despite later-generation systems getting to leapfrog off what earlier-ones learned and b) why people still use wlog checks instead of going with other methods that they could also choose to use, in 2024.<p>For example, in this issue, a major reason why some people don't do value transfer through banks directly is the banks don't really like them (for reasons), the feeling is mutual (for reasons), and <i>other</i> people who do not have the same POV re: banks want to give those people money in a scaled fashion, which (unless they orient their operations around a solution) will frequently involve sending out checks.</p>

<p>I’m glad you liked the interview.<p>Some people do not enjoy my writing style. That is fine; it’s a big Internet and there are writers with many styles on it. Some people think my style is poorly considered or unnecessary. I invite them to attempt writing a few million words. It will give one a very considered view on one’s own style.<p>I have spent half my life working in a foreign-to-me language and so I feel for non-native speakers who try to read my writing. That said, all choices in life have trade-offs. Many publications in the U.S. target a fifth to eighth grade reading level. You likely would have little difficulty reading those publications, much like I have comparatively little difficulty reading Japanese aimed at 5th graders. However, people rarely associate those publications with dense, insightful, textured prose on complicated technical and interdisciplinary subjects. (If some HNers do, awesome; stuff you’ll love is available at the obvious places on the Internet.)</p>

<p>There is a famous joke about standards: the great thing about common standards is that you have so many to choose from. A corollary to it: if none of the existing common standards meets your need, how about letting some of your senior staff get promoted by successfully creating and popularizing a new common standard?</p>

<p><i>I don’t understand what the fintech is adding to the equation.</i><p>The goal of these products is that, to you the user, it feels like "money in your account." You don't need to think of the mechanics of brokered CDs if you e.g. want to keep $750k on deposit at Schwab. You just... keep $750k on deposit at Schwab, and Schwab does some magic you don't care about, and you're insured.<p>Scale up the numbers a bit and sell it to companies, and that is the fintech pitch.</p>

<p><i>If they thought you were really money-laundering, they wouldn't close your account unless you were actually charged as that could count as "tipping off".</i><p>FYI: not accurate. A bank (etc etc) cannot will not tell a person they suspect or have actual knowledge of money laundering, but they also cannot facilitate it. There is a tiny bit of wiggle room around the edges if e.g. an investigating agency says "Definitely don't touch this until we tell you to" but that is an edge case on an edge case.</p>

<p>There has been, over the nearly century we’ve had the institution, many many waves of feelings regarding it. That said, three prominent ones: the amount one needs to reserve, and therefore the rates one needs to charge banks to build the reserve, are sensitive to what portion of the sector is actually insured. There exists a sense that rich, sophisticated people and entities can arrange for their own risk management at their own expense rather than a society-wide program with implicit government backstopping. Finally, there is frequently strong disinterest in either the reality or the appearance of public funds being used to backstop the banking industry.<p>And so that is the reason for the limit. It gets bumped up every few years, partially due to inflation and partially due to the increasing wealth of the upper middle class and retirees, who the insurance fund is primarily aimed at motivating. It would not be effective in its aims if “local elites” at the typical community bank felt like they still shouldered run risk, and  local elites in 2023 are substantially wealthier than they were in 1945.</p>

<p>The true answer, which may not be useful, is that style is what happens when one writes five million words. For the first few hundred thousand you end up sounding a lot like your favorite authors and what your teachers wanted. Then you start doubling down on what is working, try random experiments, bounce around an incentive gradient a bit, and also accumulate a decade plus of life experience and hopefully some knowledge. Eventually, people start sounding like you. There is no day in the middle where you hire a focus group of writing professionals to develop a house style guide.<p>That is a joke but not much of one; writing style guides to capture "What is... taste? How do we scale it?" is a project I've actually been involved with. This project brief has defeated many talented people, the least of which being me.</p>
