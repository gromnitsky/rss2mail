<p>One observation re: Electron: it was a security nightmare (no sandboxing! then lots of script injection / prototype pollution attack surface), so I think the better path to a host runtime is an extended browser. It has a lot of hard-fought security and privacy defense built in.</p>

<p>A couple of ways for a new "browser" to leapfrog:<p>1/ As guest in current browsers acting as hosts, for the zero-install ubiquity of the Web. This would require WebGPU, Wasm, fast JS<=>Wasm calls, and installable PWAs at least. Gatekeepers notably Apple can and will hinder. Once established, this new hosted app could be nativized to drop the browser dependency.<p>2/ As new obligate not facultative browser-like app in new device, e.g., XR eyewear. The device would have to take off at very large scale, and its maker(s) would want to do things not easily done via (1). The extant Web would be mapped onto in-world surfaces but the new device and its content stack would support things that go way beyond evolutionary improvements to the Web.<p>I used to think (2) might happen with Oculus being acquired by Meta, or by Apple eyewear, but I'm less optimistic now. The Big Tech players, especially Apple, can build nice h/w, but it won't get to scale quickly enough to subsume the Web.</p>

<p>> integers are faster than floats<p>Bignums are not faster in general and more work, but yeah: optimizing float (or bignum) to machine int is a win. This was one of the first type specializations done in the JS JIT wars of 2008.</p>

<p>It's fun to argue what-if's, up to a point. But I see a couple of factual problems:<p>1. JS via asm.js paved the way for WebAssembly, and asm.js (<a href="https://asmjs.org/" rel="nofollow">https://asmjs.org/</a>) like Wasm is statically typed. Scheme is dynamic. So there would have to be an asm.scm or similar evolutionary path, in order to get to something like Wasm even if in addition to Scheme rather than JS, for the needed win.<p>Polymorphic inline caching etc. is not enough to compete with native, e.g., to run Unreal Engine 5:<p><a href="https://x.com/spatialweeb/status/1757581115609817236" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/spatialweeb/status/1757581115609817236</a><p>Static typing matters beyond raw CPU perf, in order to prove memory safety with definite allocation -- no touching the GC or 30fps gameplay falls over.<p>2. Wasm is binary, and this matters too: while transport compression helps JS on the wire, or under the alternative, would help Scheme on the wire, the memory cost (plus CPU of LZ) blowing out the compressed payload into source form for parsing is too much for mobile, or for any head to head competition with the likes of PNaCl (which ~2012 era Google was flogging in vain -- no way it would get into Safari or other browsers).<p>Yes, binary syntaxes for Lisps exist, but it's not the case that everything can be done "with just lisp".<p>Please use factual yardsticks and apples-to-apples even for counterfactuals that would have to survive in the same ecosystem.</p>

<p>Tax year 2016 through 2022 IRS Form 990 gross comp for Mitchell sums to<p>$24,351,822<p>(Forms at <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/200097189" rel="nofollow">https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/200...</a> and on Mozilla's site.)<p>"Punching down" is a sophomoric dunce-phrase in any event, but even with the most charitable interpretation of that phrase, it's wrong. I was not punching, nor is your asserted direction "down".<p>Mitchell (along with all leadership) should not be immune from criticism, even (or especially, if the leader in part caused the downfall) if you wrongly believe that they were fired, underpaid, or running a "dying" outfit -- all of which as far as I know are false.</p>

<p>You are assuming facts not in evidence or provably false per public IRS 990 forms:<p>1. Mitchell was not as far as I know removed.<p>2. She has extracted over $20M gross pay including bonuses for the last several years. I’ll do the exact math later.<p>Let’s see how much her comp goes down in this year’s IRS Form 990, which will come out at the earliest in late 2025.<p>3. Mozilla has a ton of cash in the bank while Brave is still building a new business model. To say I’m doing better in any financial sense is cheeky. If you use Brave, thanks for your support.<p>Last thing: Mozilla will take years to die, and it could perdure as an NGO, even after Firefox. Don’t assume it will die quickly. We are all dying, in this world.</p>

<p>I don't agree with this counterfactual, much as I love Scheme among languages I've barely used in my career.<p>Chez Scheme was fast but would not fit in the browser especially on Windows 3.1, which still had the largest share when I started JS in 1995, if memory serves -- it was certainly important to Netscape because Microsoft started bundling IE into later Windows versions, as default browser in Windows 98. Petit Chez Scheme was not fast, and I'm not sure I would have had time to use it in those ten days (I never looked at the code).<p>Guile was out because of the GPL, not my choice (same as with Make It Look Like Java order) and probably no time to embed, or just no way with 64K segments.<p>If you know of another fast-in-1995 Scheme that might have fit, links welcome.</p>

<p>What a surfeit of words to fail to justify your false reply about "important things Mozilla has created" after I left.<p>You were the one who insinuated something about motives, here:<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39312219">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39312219</a><p>I already said I was not going to speculate on your motives, after easily showing your false claim: that Mozilla created Rust after I left.<p>So the only "bullshit" about motives has come from you. And you are the only one who seemed emotional, if not angry, to the point you threw "attack" as a typical DARVO move. This is pure projection.<p>It matters who did what, when. Especially in view of Mitchell's power of the purse at Mozilla. Yes, she could have killed Rust, but it would have blown up in her face and she had no need to kill it. No, she does not get credit for <i>creating Rust</i> even after I left. The Rust team was working on spin-out well before they all left. As for Servo, it is better off out of Mozilla: <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/servo-rust-web-engine/" rel="nofollow">https://news.itsfoss.com/servo-rust-web-engine/</a>.</p>

<p>Grandparent of comment to which I first replied:<p>> I can't think of any important things Mozilla has created since pushing Brendan Eich out 9 years ago.<p>Comment to which I replied, which you wrote:<p>> Rust, for example.<p>Let's recap, since you seem to have a very short context window or memory. Someone wrote they couldn't think of anything important Mozilla created after I left. You cited Rust. I testified that Rust started many years before I left and I was Rust's C-level sponsor and immediate colleague of its creator.<p>You then reappear after several nesting replies to imply I'm lying and have bad motives. After this, here we are with you ignoring your own false claim that Mozilla <i>created</i> Rust after I left. It seems to me, without ascribing motive, that you are the one with a weak grasp on the truth here, even the truth of what you wrote in prior comments on this page.</p>

<p>Don’t ignore context. The comment to which my first comment above replied implied that Mitchell (for Mozilla) was due credit for Rust.<p>Your (1) is still planting a falsehood: Mitchell’s role when I sponsored Rust was not CEO, she did not have to approve or reject Rust, but she did assent to my advice that we make Rust an official project.<p>This is not an attack, it’s simply what happened. You are the one who keeps concern trolling, or whatever it is you are doing, to give Mitchell undue credit or to shield her from anything that could be taken as criticism.</p>

<p>I was executive sponsor of Rust, which Graydon Hoare was doing as a personal project while working with me on ES4. Rob Sayre, JS team manager, agreed Rust should be an official project, so Graydon went full time on Rust at Mozilla. This was in 2008.<p>Later, others notably Niko Matsakis and Patrick Walton (apologies for leaving yet other folks’ names out) took Rust to 1.0.<p>Mitchell didn’t know what Rust was until I explained it, wasn’t CEO when we made it an official project, but was CEO for this:<p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-rust-mozilla-job-cuts-have-hit-us-badly-but-heres-how-well-survive/" rel="nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-rust-mozi...</a></p>

<p>Here's proof salary isn't the issue: not only did I not stay and say whatever it took to give Google antitrust cover while hiking my salary (Mitchell would have been chair, would have had to approve, might have done so provided hers went up too; she always earned a bit more than I did while we were partners from early days), I didn't go to a Big Tech company that pays seven figure salaries to people at my level. I founded a startup and still make a modest (16x smaller than Mitchell's, to be precise) salary.<p>If I'd stayed at Mozilla, turned around Firefox, spawned other revenue lines, then of course the salary would be high -- it would have to be very high, without any equity upside. This remains a problem for comp at Mozilla from when I was there: we can't compete with Big Tech on RSUs, or even on cash, so we overpay a bit and have a "mission-based" ethos that, over time, tolerated politicking and goldbricking.</p>
