<p>The real problem is not translating code. It's translating data types. If you can determine that a "char *" in C can be a Vec in Rust, you're most of the way there. It's no longer ambiguous what to do with the accesses.<p>This is where I think LLMs could help. Ask an LLM "In this code, could variable "buf" be safely represented as a Rust "Vec", and if so, what is its length?. LLMs don't really know the languages, but they have access to many samples, which is probably good enough to get a correct guess most of the time. That's enough to provide annotation hints to a dumb translator. The problem here is translating C idioms to Rust idioms, which is an LLM kind of problem.</p>

<p>> The idea behind the current c2rust tool is that you'd do a one-shot conversion to Rust and then gradually do refactoring passes over the barely-Rust code to convert it to correct C code.<p>I've seen what comes out of the transpiler. Nobody should touch that code by hand. It's awful Rust, and uglier than the original C. Modifying that by hand is like modifying compiler-generated machine code.<p>> This is actually why C23 made VLA support semi-mandatory.<p>C23 doesn't actually use that info. You can't get the size of buf from buf. I proposed something like that 12 years ago.[1] But I wanted to add enough features to check it.<p>[1] <a href="http://animats.com/papers/languages/safearraysforc43.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://animats.com/papers/languages/safearraysforc43.pdf</a></p>

<p>> C-to-Rust transpiler is a pretty doable project.<p>It's been done, but what comes out is terrible Rust. Everything is unsafe types with C semantics.<p>An intelligent C to Rust translator would be a big win. You'd need to annotate the input C with info about how long arrays are and such, to guide the translator. It might be possible to use an LLM to analyze the code and provide annotations. Usually, C code does have array length info; it's just not in a form that the language ties to the array itself. If you see<p><pre><code>    char* buf = malloc(len);
</code></pre>
the programmer knows that "buf" has length "len", but the programmer does not. Something needs to annotate "buf" with that info so that the translator knows it. Then the translator can generate Rust:<p><pre><code>    let mut buf = vec![0;len];
</code></pre>
The payoff comes at calls. C code:<p><pre><code>    int write_to_device(char* buf, size_t len)
</code></pre>
is a common idiom. LLMs are good at idioms. At this point, one can guess that this
is equivalent to<p><pre><code>    fn write_to_device(buf: &[u8]) -> i32 
</code></pre>
in Rust. Then the translator has to track "len" to make sure that<p><pre><code>    assert_eq!(buf.len(), len);
</code></pre>
is either provably true, or put in that assert to check it at run time.
So that's a path to translation into safe Rust.<p>Funding could probably be obtained from Homeland Security for this, given the new White House level interest in safe languages and the headaches being caused by the cyber war. Is CVS still down?</p>

<p>The California Water Project was intended to have enough capacity for three years of drought. It was when we started having 4-6 years of low rain that it got bad.<p>I don't know if they still have it, but at one time the California Department of Water Resources' control center had a sign "California Drought Control Center" on one side, and "California Flood Control Center" on the other. The sign was turned over every few years as appropriate.</p>

<p>This gets past trying to simulate a film camera and tries to simulate the human visual system. That's useful. Another step towards reality and away from simulating obsolete technology. Shutter-type motion blur may go the way of sepia-toned prints, 16 FPS black and white movies, and elliptical wheels from mechanical shutters.</p>

<p>Right. This should be helpful for all 3D printing. Finite element analysis on infill patterns looks like it helps.<p>This pattern looks like it's designed for an isotropic material. 
Sintered metal printers ought to produce solid metal. Extrusion printers, though, tend to have weaker inter-layer bonds than bonds within the layer.
So this may not work as well in PLA. Might need a pattern that compensates for the weaker inter-layer bonds.</p>

<p>For big operations such as Western Union, it was store and forward.
Links were point to point links with messages hand-copied to paper at relay stations. Paper messages were sorted by hand, and re-sent by outgoing operators. Large buildings with large staffs were required.[1] KPH was such a relay station, where messages went from land lines to radio and back.<p>Low-traffic lines and railroads tended to have many stations on one wire. Similarly, ships could talk to each other by radio. To get into the interconnected system, you had to go through a gateway to a commercial network, and there would be charges incurred at that point.<p>[1] <a href="https://www.wondersofworldengineering.com/telegraph_office.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.wondersofworldengineering.com/telegraph_office.h...</a></p>
