<p>Yes, look at ollama. You'll be able to run CodeLlama 70B at Q6_K with lots of memory to spare. It won't be very fast though.</p>

<p>Public transport in the UK is trapped in a vicious cycle. The system is poor, so people buy cars, which means fewer people use the system, which means less investment, which means the system gets even worse, so more people buy cars. Despite all its ills, driving is, for enough people, a more pleasant experience than tackling strikes, standing on a train for two hours, or being unable to travel at certain times at all.<p>I have to go on a cross country journey this Sunday which would suit the use of the train, except there <i>are none at all</i> on my section of the main line early in the morning, so I shall drive all the way into London. The data may make it look as if no-one needs or wants to use the train early on a Sunday, except we might, if we had the option.</p>

<p>To be honest, the best method is to find good Go libraries and do some code reading. Not every project will be using best practices, even those created by prominent Go developers, but if you read through several libraries, you'll pick things up by osmosis.<p>That said, <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout" rel="nofollow">https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout</a> and <a href="https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout">https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout</a> may help.</p>

<p>To be fair, under the current ridiculous IRS rules, <i>all</i> software development is "R&D", so it's not particularly surprising. Perhaps when only 10% of their expenditure was on R&D, software development wasn't included in that (much as it is not in my own country).</p>

<p>A couple of ideas:<p>1) Use GitHub code search to find those files. A lot of people store them in GitHub repos.<p>2) <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn" rel="nofollow">https://reddit.com/r/unixporn</a> – it's very common to share dot files against submissions, though they do tend to be by the more creative types.</p>

<p>Thanks, I'm going to give that a go too. The good news is the very latest Ollama update (0.1.27) has resolved things (though I also had to redownload the quant model for 7B).</p>

<p>That's useful to know. My experiments with the 4bit 7B currently tagged for use on ollama are not going well at all. Lots of refusals and junk. Downloading 7b-instruct-fp16 now! :-)  (Update: Yes, much better, though much slower too, of course.)</p>

<p>To compare, running Ollama with Q4 Mixtral on my 24GB 3090 Ti locally (with 22.5GB of the 26GB model on the GPU) I get 14 tok/s generation, so the Hetzner server and the 4000 really aren't bad at all (notably my 3090 draws 70W during inference also).</p>

<p>It can't be disputed that (central) London is one of the world's biggest tourist attractions, and much of it is geared towards activities. But it's far from the only factor to life in a city that's larger, more diverse, and more distinctive than ever. It's one of the most varied places in the entire world when it comes to demography, wealth, cultures, and opportunities – is this a bad thing?</p>

<p>Possibly. It's not a bad idea! The performance is pretty good in our initial tests, though cloud platforms do scale further in terms of concurrency.<p>Given how quickly things are changing, using more generic hardware (i.e. PCs and Nvidia cards) or leasing cloud based services might make more business sense in the long term, so investigating fallbacks with more control, like this server, are worthwhile experiments anyway.<p>Further, while I've been an Apple superfan for a couple of decades now, their recent attitude towards developers stinks, and I'm loathe to give them any more money than I need to right now, so I might be migrating away from the platform in any case.</p>

<p>I got it after a few hours. You need to install drivers/CUDA yourself, but all very straightforward. Unfortunately due to having 20GB of VRAM, I'm limited to mixtral:8x7b-instruct-v0.1-q2_K but it runs fine, generating at about 40 tokens/s (65 tok/s for eval). As per official specs, it's running maxed out at 70W (being an SFF card).<p>(I've now tried running the Q4 mixtral which is 26GB. 18GB is on GPU, 8GB through CPU. Gets about 11 tok/s.)</p>

<p>I've just ordered one to ditz around with. We're early in the process of deploying our own internal server for Mixtral work, but it'll be interesting to see how this performs (in raw terms, almost certainly worse, since we can roll out a 4090 without getting into trouble – but Hetzner has a better connection and handles the maintenance, so..) Order has been accepted but not deployed yet. I'll update when I have some initial inference numbers.</p>

<p>NVIDIA's licensing. Note that the 3060/3070 is a "GeForce" whereas a 4000 is a "Quadro".
