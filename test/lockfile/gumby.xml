<p>> You just have to first hack … another suitable species (or their technological artifacts) wherever you want to go, and have them create the biological substrate and download/upload mechanism on their end.<p>I presume humans are the result of such a hack a few billion years ago.<p>Interstellar travel require patience, at least to get beyond the initial latency.</p>

<p>I’ve only started companies in Silicon Valley (not even in SF once it started to get tech too) but have been on board in NY, Cambridge MA, and Europe.<p>As a broad generalization: investors in Northern California are more afraid of missing out on the upside than losing some in the downside.  The further east you go the more risk averse they get, until by the time you get to Europe the terms tend to be quite abusive because the investors are so worried about losing their money.</p>

<p>Liq prefs vanished during the ZIRP and I haven’t seen them return…yet.<p>But the founders do have some leverage.  If there is no incentive to do the deal they can just… not cause the deal to happen (different from blocking it, just not working on it).<p>This is the same reasons you see big pay packets for the execs when a company is doing poorly or is bankrupt: otherwise they could just go do something else (get a different job).  The poor guy on the assembly line may not have the same option.</p>

<p>> Adam Osborne, creator of the Osborne 1<p>I think this is a correct way to put it, but FWIW on HN: the person who actually designed the device (not just the hardware) was the legendary Lee Felsenstein.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Felsenstein" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Felsenstein</a></p>

<p>Gates and Jobs were not at all rivals during the short time Osborne Computers existed.  I don't think there even was an MS-DOS back then; IIRC, the Osborne 1 ran CP/M.<p>(I almost wrote "Osborne-1" but conveniently there is an Osborne 1 sticker on my desk and I happened to glance at it!)</p>

<p>> The MacBook Air used to have a multiple USB-A ports plus video, now it 2 ports that have to handle everything.<p>I doubt this is much of a constraint in the real world.  Most people plug power in, perhaps an external mouse, and that's it.  (They should be plugging in external storage for backups, which might require an extra port, but I doubt most people do in practice).<p>> So now the dongle/no dongle question has to become considered as well.<p>I'm pretty much USB-C only at this point, but even before then I never understood the fixation on "dongles".</p>

<p>By and large: yes.<p>Higher density cities are the ecologically least damaging mode of housing and provide more of what makes cities great: more people doing interesting things, more opportunities for interactions, education, access to health care, etc.<p>Now there are plenty of people who <i>don't</i> want that, but then they don't want to be in an urban environment at all.  So I'm not saying it's winning for every person.  But on a continuum from ultra-rural to ultra dense I think a graph of "quality of life for residents-by-choice" would be a saddle curve.  Less dense cities, and most suburbs (by the US definition) are neither fish nor fowl.</p>

<p>Law-permitted discretionary exemptions are reasonable <i>in extremis</i> which I think California’s water situation is, a couple of good years notwithstanding.  People can find any number of ways to be corrupt as well all know.<p>Since you’re not in the US: California’s woes are vastly overstated.  There are indeed real problems, but the government here is remarkably clean — shockingly so by the standards of East Coast States (original colonies) and in general California has a good track record of dealing with many major issues. We can all list unresolved longstanding problems we hate (my list is pretty much prisons, schools, housing NIMBYs and prop 13) but as a general rule they do ok.<p>Also this is non partisan.  Geographically CA is mostly “MAGA red” but corruption etc is pretty thinly and uniformly spread around.</p>

<p>I was surprised that SQ was the only third party airline to have its livery on Concorde, as I saw plenty of pictures of Concordes with Braniff livery on on side.<p>Well, I did remember correctly that the service operated from Dallas (to NY or Washington).  Subsonic only, and with lots of crazy adaptation to fit the crazy laws, like changing the aircraft registration number on each flight.<p>But all those pictures I saw were advertising drawings: <a href="https://www.heritageconcorde.com/braniff-airways-concorde-operations" rel="nofollow">https://www.heritageconcorde.com/braniff-airways-concorde-op...</a></p>

<p>The state has been releasing water in order to leave room for this winter’s snowfall.<p>We still have a lot of risk: the snowpack is part of our reservoir system, but warm summers have been melting the snow faster than usual. So it’s good the state wants to build additional reservoir capacity.</p>

<p>Yes, but in Australia root means to fuck.<p>Also the somewhat old fashioned phrase “Up the [magpies or other team]” also would have the opposite meaning in the US than it does in Aus.  In fact I hear the US meaning more and more, probably due to TV</p>
