<p>My understanding is that French abortion protections are somewhat more conservative than those of Kansas, which for instance has a 21 week cutoff versus France's 14, and requires no additional consults or cooling off period.</p>

<p>You've given up the argument at this point. If you don't trust your phone's manufacturer not to backdoor their own chips, the baseband doesn't matter. If you're concerned about the Qualcomm baseband chips in an iPhone, you're talking about what is probably (depending on your phone) just a USB peripheral.<p>The baseband parts here are not, as message board C.W. would have it, top secret unknowable wizard hardware. You can get the part numbers and look them up.<p>There's a lot of weird mythology about these modem parts. The thread you linked to included someone claiming that basebands were DMA'ing into host memory --- you couldn't even do DMA over the HSIC USB the parts were using. Like, it wasn't even physically possible.<p>(I have no idea what a 5G Snapdragon Xwhatever can do today, but I assure you that Apple's security team does).</p>

<p>They don't believe that because they're innumerate, they believe that because the 2020 election was conducted under extraordinary circumstances that are unlikely to repeat. The rest of your points thus have the causality reversed.</p>

<p>I talk to friends on Slack, Messenger, Signal, and WhatsApp. I virtually never talk to someone I actually know on email, a trend that started in ~2014 when I discovered Slack.<p>I do still use email! But only for transactional stuff, like FOIA requests or scheduling local government meetings.</p>

<p>Here in today's Atlantic is an example of what I'm talking about, though it's been nowhere nearly that bad here (for instance, thus far, there haven't been whole-classroom walkouts at OPRF --- though we do have teachers signing off on student groups making t-shirts celebrating October 7).<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/04/us-anti-semitism-jewish-american-safety/677469/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/04/us-anti...</a></p>

<p>This bounced around in my brain all day yesterday and I think it's a miserable example. You might be right in general, I don't know, but 2020 isn't the right data point to use.<p>The situation in 2020 was unique. If you had tasked state governments with coming up with an election process that would guarantee alarming late-breaking swings, you couldn't have done better than what Pennsylvania did. Because of COVID, mail-in ballots strongly correlated with party affiliation. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania government set up ballot counting rules that ensured those ballots would be counted late. The state literally set up the conditions for one party's results to come in first, and in states like PA (and now GA and AZ) the margins are so thin that any structural effect like that is going to produce the same outcome.<p>You're going to say "well that's my point", but my argument is that 2020 is sui generis, and that states are going to do a bunch of things differently in 2024, beyond just the fact that Democrats are going to vote in person about the same as they did in 2016.</p>

<p>Wait, what's so hard to understand about that scenario? If a Trump lead at 80% necessarily meant a Trump win, you could just call the election at 80%.</p>

<p>I live in an extraordinarily liberal, extraordinarily inclusive, extraordinarily communitarian enclave of Chicagoland, and I just watched a school board meeting (I am in the kind of community where everyone watches the school board meeting) where 6 households back to back got up to the public comment podium and talked about the specific, materially important physical safety issues they are currently, personally, experiencing as Jewish Americans.<p>I am not sticking up for ADL, which I agree has tilted way too far towards the defense of the Israeli government and surrendered some credibility in the process. JVP is controversial for good reason, and it is not reasonable for people to cite JVP as evidence that mainstream Jewish Americans broadly agree with a maximalist anti-Israel position. But they are not a hate group.<p>Right now I look at ADL the same way I look at RationalWiki. I don't trust editorialisms from RationalWiki at all. Who would? But when RationalWiki presents receipts, I look at the receipts. ADL's "editorial" voice is not very useful right now, but their specific reporting often is.<p>At any rate, my major point here is: Jewish Americans face unique, widespread, material safety issues. If you're operating under the impression that it's easy to be Jewish in America as it is to be Irish Catholic, do some reading and revise that opinion. From what I can see, that would be a very difficult claim to defend.</p>
